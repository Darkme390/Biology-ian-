    <br>1.Mitosis<br>2.Meiosis</p>
<p><b>Mitosis</b><br>This is the form of cell devision were two 
       deploid daughter cells are produced from on parend cell.<p>

         <hr><p><b>Meiosis</b><br>This is the form of cell division where four
       haploid duagther cells are produced from one parent cell.

  <p><B><u>SIMILALITIES BETWEEN MEIOSIS AND MITOSIS</u></B>
<br>-Both form daugther cells<br>-Both need energy
    <br>-Both involve interphase,prophase,metaphase,anaphase and telophase
    <br>-In both a spindle is formed</p>
         <p><b><u>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS</U></B>
           <br>-In mitosis two cells are formed while in meiosis four cells are produced 
           <br>-In mitosis each cell formed has 46 chromosomes while in meiosis each cell formed has 23 chromosomes</p>
